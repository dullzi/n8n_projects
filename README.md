# n8n_projects
This repository contains a collection of n8n workflows that I use to automate a wide range of processes. The workflows cover various automation needs, including:

🤖 Telegram FAQ Chatbot

📘 AI-Based Curriculum Generator

📝 Automated Blog Creation & Publishing to Google Drive

📰 Automated Blog Creation & Publishing to Dev.to

📦 Product Stock Checking Automation

📅 Daily Scheduled Automation Tasks

🖼️ Curriculum File Converter to Google Slides

Each workflow is organized into its own folder to ensure clarity, easy navigation, and better maintainability. This repository serves as documentation and a centralized version-controlled archive of all automation workflows I have built using n8n.
